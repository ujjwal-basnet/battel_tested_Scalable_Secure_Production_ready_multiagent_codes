# battel_tested_Scalable_Secure_Production_ready_multiagent_codes

Production-ready patterns and example code for multi-agent LLM systems with safe PII handling.

This repository contains compact, practical pieces you can reuse when building agentic systems in production. It focuses on three goals:

- Safety: detect and mask PII before sending data to external LLMs or APIs.
- Simplicity: small, testable modules and clear, opinionated defaults for developers to adopt and extend.
- Practicality: runnable examples (FastAPI) and small test harnesses.

## Contents

- `ai_strategy_architecture/` — main example package
  - `wrapping_langchainOn_fastapi_endpoint.py` — FastAPI wrapper that sanitizes input and routes queries
  - `pii_utils.py` — PII detection & anonymization helpers (Presidio if available, regex fallback otherwise)
  - `basic_agent_router.py` — routing logic (langchain-backed in full install; fallback used for dev)
  - tests: `test_pii_utils.py`, `test_basic_agent_router.py`
- `pyproject.toml` — project metadata and optional extras
- Example notebooks and notes in `code_explains/`

## Quick design summary

1. Accept user query at an HTTP endpoint.
2. Detect PII in the query using `pii_utils.analyze_pii()`.
3. If PII exists, anonymize the query (placeholders) and route the sanitized text to downstream agents/LLMs.
4. Restore placeholders in the final user-facing response if necessary using `restore_placeholders()`.

This strategy prevents leaking raw credentials or sensitive identifiers to third-party services while allowing transparent responses to users.

## Quickstart — development (conda)

Recommended: use conda for system dependency isolation (fast and reliable for binary packages).

1. Create the environment and install runtime deps:

```bash
conda create -n ai_arch_env python=3.11 -y
conda activate ai_arch_env
pip install -e .
# If you want Presidio (heavy), optionally:
pip install .[presidio]
```

2. Run the FastAPI app (from repository root):

```bash
uvicorn ai_strategy_architecture.wrapping_langchainOn_fastapi_endpoint:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

Open: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

API key (dev): the example uses a hardcoded `X-API-KEY: ujjwal` for rapid local testing. Replace this with a proper secret in `config.py` or via env vars before production.

## Quickstart — pip-only / venv

```bash
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
# optional: pip install .[presidio]
uvicorn ai_strategy_architecture.wrapping_langchainOn_fastapi_endpoint:app --reload
```

## PII behavior

- `pii_utils.analyze_pii(text)` returns a list of detected entities. It will:
  - Use Presidio if installed and configured (recommended for production redaction accuracy).
  - Fall back to a conservative regex-based detector for emails and card-like numbers when Presidio is not available (good for dev).
- `pii_utils.anonymize_with_placeholders(text, matches)` replaces sensitive spans with unique placeholders and returns a mapping for restoration.
- `pii_utils.restore_placeholders(text, mapping)` restores original values.

Security note: Placeholder mappings are ephemeral and should never be persisted in logs or external systems. If you must persist them, encrypt and rotate keys.

## Configuration

- Environment-driven config via `pydantic-settings` in `ai_strategy_architecture/config.py`.
- For production, set required secrets as environment variables or use a secrets manager. The example prints a quick verification at import time (remove or replace with proper validation in real deployments).

## Tests

Unit tests are in `ai_strategy_architecture/test_*.py` and are fast when mocking heavy dependencies. Run all tests with:

```bash
pytest -q
```

Note: Presidio-based integration tests are intentionally separate (they require downloading spaCy models and are slower). Mark them with a custom marker (e.g., `@pytest.mark.integration`) and run them only in CI or dedicated integration stages.

## Next improvements (suggested)

- Initialize Presidio engines and registries at FastAPI startup to avoid reloading models per request.
- Run analyzers in a threadpool to avoid blocking the event loop.
- Replace the hardcoded API key with `settings.API_KEY` and validate at startup.
- Add GitHub Actions to run unit tests and a separate integration workflow for Presidio tests.
- Add a Dockerfile and a small orchestration example for production deployment.
