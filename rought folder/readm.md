**Real-World, Production-Ready Multi-Agent Implementations**

##  PII Detection & Redaction

Before sending **user data** to any **third-party LLM** or external **API**, the system must **detect and mask sensitive information** (emails, passwords, API keys, etc.) to prevent **data leakage**.

---

###  Example Scenario

**User Input:**

> my gmail is [ram12@gmail.com](mailto:ram12@gmail.com) and password is 'hari12' please help me to login

We must detect and mask all sensitive data before forwarding it to any external service.

---


```
1. SEARCH for sensitive data in user_input (email, password, API keys, etc.)
2. IF detected:
       FOR EACH detected_item:
            REPLACE detected_item WITH a placeholder
            Example:
              password: 'hari12' â†’ password: '<password>'
3. RETURN sanitized user_input
```

---

###  Example Output

**Before Masking:**

> my gmail is [ram12@gmail.com](mailto:ram12@gmail.com) and password is 'hari12' please help me to login

**After Masking:**

> my gmail is <my_gmail> and password is <my_password> please help me to login

---


now we can send this to llm and after llma response we can  **Restore** original values (e.g., `<my_gmail>` to  actual email) in the final response before returning it to the user.
