## Enterprise Enviroment Setup And Configuration 
In enterprise deployment:

Code goes inside container (Docker image).and 

Configuration stays outside — passed in via environment variables, .env files, or secrets manager (Vault, AWS SSM, etc.).

which  lets us to  run the same container in different environments with different behavior 

         from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings
         
         class AppConfig(BaseSettings):
            APP_ENV: str

```
BaseSettings uses os.environ to check if APP_ENV is defined.

If not found, it checks for a .env file if configured (default behavior is to look for .env in root).

It automatically loads variables from .env using python-dotenv internally.

Validates that APP_ENV exists and matches the expected type (str here).

Returns a validated, immutable AppConfig instance.

# Simple Multi Agent Architecture Router 

Big companies usually use multiple specialized agents — each focused on a specific task.
In this architecture, every user request enters the system through a Router.
The router inspects the query and, based on predefined rules or LLM classification, directs it to the most appropriate agent.

We typically use a lightweight, low-cost LLM for routing.
